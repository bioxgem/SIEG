# Systematic Identification of Essential Genes (SIEG)
To construct a comprehensive catalog of pan-cancer CEGs and their corresponding mechanisms as potential therapeutic targets, we integrated diverse biological datasets and applied a machine learning model to prioritize pan-cancer essentiality based on single-gene pathway regulation behaviors. To systematically assess both genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, we incorporated genomic, transcriptomic, functional, and prognostic datasets (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, we developed SIEG model to assess functional-level essentiality by analyzing pan-cancer influence on both essential and non-essential pathways (Fig. 1B). This enabled the identification of pan-cancer CEGs, whose shared regulatory behaviors were categorized into six essential signatures (e.g., transcription, translation, folding and degradation, replication and repair, cell growth and death, energy), distinguishing different pan-cancer CEG types (Fig. 1C): C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> are classic pan-cancer CEGs which are in charge of DNA replication and repair and cell growth and death. C<sub>3</sub> is pan-lethal CEGs due to transcription and protein folding and degradation emerging in both tumor and normal cells. C<sub>4</sub> are tumor-selective CEGs because of the regulations of energy metabolism (Fig. 1D). To identify potential therapeutic targets, we further integrated clinical outcome data to evaluate patient survival across multiple cancers, considering both cellular and individual vulnerabilities (Fig. 1E).
